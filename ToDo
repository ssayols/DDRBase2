(+) 1. Remove the IMB logo / link
  --> what, instead?
(+) 2. Correct treatment names: Aphidicolin, Sodium Arsenite
(+) 3. Exchange the uniprot link for a link directly to the correct protein
4. Heatmaps:
  (+)- Change colors: different colors for up / downregulation; use colorblind-friendly colors
  (+)- Rather than keeping the heatmap the same size, display a bigger heatmap if there are more sites (keep the zooming option)
  (+)- Only display the site position of the canonical protein isoform
  (+)- it's nice to get the site information when hovering over the heatmap. Please add the FDR and the sequence window (middle -/+6)
  (+)- indicate significantly regulated sites with an asterik
  (+)- what are the functions ("show closest data on hover, ... ") doing?
    --? Nothing at all for heatmaps. Removed
  (?)-is it possible to add a link from the phospho sites to the phosphosite plus site?
(?)5. Before the heatmap it would be great to have a graph showing the domains of the protein (including size information). Measured and regulated sites should be indicated for a quick overview.
